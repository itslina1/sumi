		 	Mimi, 
		 	<br>
		 	I wanted to write you this letter to make a few promises, because you deserve to know how committed I am to being the best friend I can be.
		 	<br>
		 	First and foremost, I promise to always be there for you. No matter what happens, you can count on me. Whether you need someone to listen, or just someone to fool with, I’ll be there. You’ve always been there for me, and I want you to know that I’ll always do the same for you.
		 	<br>
		 	I promise to support you in everything you do. Your dreams and goals are important to me, and I want to see you succeed. I’ll be your biggest cheerleader, celebrating your victories. Whatever you aspire to, I’ll be right there, encouraging you every step of the way.
		 	<br>
		 	I promise to be honest with you. Trust is the foundation of our friendship, and I value it deeply. I will always tell you the truth, even when it’s hard, because you deserve nothing less. And I trust that you’ll do the same for me.
		 	<br>
		 	I promise to make time for you. Life can get busy, but our friendship is a priority for me. I’ll make sure we have our moments together, whether it’s a long chat, a short one, or just our fangirling over Wooseok. Your company means the world to me.
		 	<br>
		 	Lastly, I promise to love you unconditionally. You are an amazing person, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life. I will always cherish and appreciate you for who you are, just as you are.

Thank you for being such an incredible friend. I’m so lucky to have you, and I look forward to keeping these promises and making our friendship even stronger.
		 	<br>
		 	I love you <3

		</p>
