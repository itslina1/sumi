				I’ve been wanting to write you this letter for a while, just to let you know how much you mean to me. We talk every day, and sometimes I feel like I don’t say enough about how much I appreciate you.

				You’ve been such a huge part of my life, and I can’t even begin to tell you how much that means to me. Your kindness, your sense of humor, and the way you just get me—it’s all so special. You have this amazing ability to make everything better, no matter what’s going on. Your support and encouragement have kept me going more times than I can count.
				
				I think about all the times we’ve laughed until we cried, and those deep talks that went on for hours. Those moments are some of the best memories I have. You make the everyday stuff feel extraordinary, and I love that about you.
				
				You’ve seen me at my best and my worst, and you’ve never judged me. Instead, you’ve always been there with a kind word or a listening ear. I admire your strength and the way you handle life’s ups and downs with such grace. It’s something I truly look up to.
				
				I want you to know that no matter what, I’ll always be here for you too. Our friendship is one of the most important things in my life, and I’m so grateful for it. You’re not just my friend; you’re family to me.
				
				Thank you for being you, for all the laughs, the advice, and the countless memories. I’m so lucky to have you in my life, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us. Just know that you’re always in my heart and on my mind.
			<br>
			
			Love,
          	<br>Luna
